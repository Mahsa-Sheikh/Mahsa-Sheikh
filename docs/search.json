A region of my hometown, Ramsar, is the most radioactive inhabited area known on Earth due to nearby hot springs and construction material derived from the region. A team of researchers from the Department of Public Health at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBMU) performed a clinical study linking oral manifestations to living in a radioactive area. From that moment, I realized that environmental factors are essential in oral health.\nIn 2011, I was admitted to a restorative residency program with a clinical focus in my dream dental school at Shahid Beheshti Medical University (SBMU). I also joined a dental materials research lab at the SBMU Research Institute of Dental Science and continued to work throughout my residency. The lab was specialized in physicomechanical analysis of dental materials.\nMy search for a rich program focused on patient-oriented research attracted me to the PhD program in Clinical Translational Science program. It seems that this program makes an opportunity for me to gain experience in field of clinical sciences and translational sciences.The advanced courses, covering different areas of science and research methods, are challenging and require me to learn things that are new and unfamiliar. Although challenges can be difficult, they are essential for growth and provide the opportunity to build new skills, gain confidence, and ultimately succeed in the field.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles. I invite you to explore my website. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "title": "Moving a World Beyond P Value",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In research, the p-value is often used to decide whether a result is statistically significant. However, a small p-value doesn’t always mean the result is important or useful in real life. As pointed out in the editorial Moving to a World Beyond ‘p &lt; 0.05’, statistical significance does not guarantee that the effect is meaningful or true. A small p-value may suggest an effect, but if the effect size is small, the result may have little real-world impact. This is especially important in areas like healthcare, where the real value of a treatment should be considered alongside its statistical significance.\nChanging the way we think about statistics and decision-making can be difficult, as old habits are hard to break. As psychologist Kurt Lewin once said, “If you want to truly understand something, try to change it.” While it’s important to look beyond just the p-value, researchers must also consider the effect size, sample size, and context of the study. This helps us see if a result is truly meaningful, not just statistically significant. By educating others and encouraging collaboration across fields, we can ensure research findings have real value and impact. Focusing on the bigger picture, rather than just p-values, will lead to better decision-making in many areas of life."
