# Meet Me

My enthusiasm to pursue an education beyond practicing general dentistry
comes from my involvement with an oral health project in my hometown
while I was a dental student. A region of my hometown, Ramsar, is the
most radioactive inhabited area known on Earth due to nearby hot springs
and construction material derived from the region. A team of researchers
from the Department of Public Health at Shahid Beheshti University of
Medical Sciences (SBMU) performed a clinical study linking oral
manifestations to living in a radioactive area. From that moment, I
realized that environmental factors are essential in oral health.

In 2011, I was admitted to a restorative residency program with a
clinical focus in my dream dental school at Shahid Beheshti Medical
University (SBMU). I also joined a dental materials research lab at the
SBMU Research Institute of Dental Science and continued to work
throughout my residency. The lab was specialized in physicomechanical
analysis of dental materials.

My search for a rich program focused on patient-oriented research
attracted me to the PhD program in Clinical Translational Science
program. It seems that this program makes an opportunity for me to gain
experience in field of clinical sciences and translational sciences.The advanced courses, covering different areas of science and research methods, are challenging and require me to learn things that are new and unfamiliar. Although challenges can be difficult, they are essential for growth and provide the opportunity to build new skills, gain confidence, and ultimately succeed in the field.

On this website, you will find a selection of my published works,
including scholarly articles. I invite you to explore my website. Please
feel free to [contact me](mailto:sxs3195@case.edu) if you have any
questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
